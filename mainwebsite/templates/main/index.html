                            Beginning in the first few weeks of the fall and spring semesters, recruitment consists of two rounds of professional and social events designed to help prospective members determine whether or not DSP is the right fit for them. After the first round, prospective members that have made a good impression and demonstrated promising fit will be invited to a second round. We encourage all Freshmen and Sophomore students that are interested in joining to follow our Facebook and Instagram to be updated when recruitment starts and come out to an info session to learn more.

                                The Sigma Tau chapter prides itself on creating a tight-knit community and well-rounded experience that spans beyond professional and academic settings. To foster camaraderie between its brothers, we host a cabin retreat, semi-formal, dinners in downtown Durham, movie nights, spikeball tournaments, and various other social events every semester. Joining DSP guarantees that there is always something and someone to do things with. The people you meet will become some of your closest friends during and after college.

                                Delta Sigma Pi is dedicated to making a difference in the Durham community because we believe that business has both a unique opportunity and a compelling duty to contribute to the larger community. The Sigma Tau chapter works closely with the Duke Farms, Habitat for Humanity, and Ronald McDonald House through community service and fundraising events. We also host an annual Swishes for Scholarships basketball tournament that has raised over $2,500 for the Durham Public Schools Scholarship Foundation to send public school students to college.
